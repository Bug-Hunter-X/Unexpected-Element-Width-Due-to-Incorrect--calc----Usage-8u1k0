/*
  This CSS demonstrates the correct way to use `calc()` to set the width of an element,
  taking into account padding and border.  The key is to subtract the padding and border
  from the 100% calculation to ensure the total width is as expected.
*/

.container {
  width: calc(100% - 20px); /* Subtract padding and border */
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

/* You can adjust the padding and border values as needed. */
