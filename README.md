This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS to set the width of an element. The issue arises from not properly accounting for padding and border when performing the calculation.  The `bug.css` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.css` provides the correct solution.  The problem is described in detail within the respective CSS files themselves as comments.
